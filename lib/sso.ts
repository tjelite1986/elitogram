/**
 * Who is browsing, according to elite-v2.
 *
 * Elitogram has no accounts. It sits on the same parent domain as elite-v2,
 * which scopes its session cookie to that domain, so a browser logged in there
 * sends the same cookie here. That gets the token to us; it does not tell us
 * whether it is still good. Verifying the signature locally would need
 * elite-v2's `JWT_SECRET`, and would still accept a session that has been
 * revoked — the row proving it exists is in elite-v2's database, and a revoked
 * token stays signed for a week. So the token goes back to elite-v2 to be
 * resolved, and the signing secret stays in the one app that needs it.
 *
 * The cost is a round trip. It is paid over the internal docker network
 * (`ELITE_VERIFY_URL` points at the container, not the public hostname) and
 * answers are cached for 30 s, so a page that resolves the session several
 * times asks once and revocation lags by at most that.
